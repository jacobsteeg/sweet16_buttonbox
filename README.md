This Arduino Sketch was partially written by ChatGPT to use the Sweet16 macro pad from 1upKeyboards as a USB game controller.
I wasnt able to find any sketches that did exactly what I wanted, and with the QMK Joystick integration just giving me bug after bug, I went this route.
Upload this sketch to your Sweet16 macro pad and ejoy your button box!
